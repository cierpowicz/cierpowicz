# Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🎉

Hi, I am Piotrek, a graduate of the University of Economics in Wroclaw on the faculty of Engineering and Production Management. I am a self-taught programmer and a hobbyist in pentesting. I am currently preparing for the CCNA exam.

On this platform, you'll find a range of projects, including my main projects: 

- :seedling: Self Watering Plant -> [here](https://github.com/cierpowicz/Self-Watering-Plant): This project is my engineering work. It uses Python programming language, components such as Rasbery Pi micro computer, soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors and others. The goal is to create a system that will monitor parameters and water the plant autonomously

- :house_with_garden: IoT Home  -> [here](https://github.com/cierpowicz/IoT-Home-): This project involves monitoring media consumption at home. Various meters such as a water consumption meter using ModBus TCP have been used for measurements. The goal is to collect information on consumption and then present the results.  

- In addition, it provides various tutorials on networking, hacking, configuration of network devices.  -> [here](https://gist.github.com/cierpowicz).

On a lighter note, did you know that cows moo with regional accents? 🐮😂

Thanks for stopping by, and I look forward to hearing from you! 😊
